### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex and I am a Software Engineer who is mainly focused on the following tech stack:

- SAP
- Python
- Web (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Microsoft Azure

Although I started my career as a SAP developer, I'm constantly trying to develop my skills in IT. Currently, I have several projects going on which are developed for the Azure cloud. There are also plans to automate internal processes with the usage of AI.  

In addition to software development, I also love all types of art and when I have enough time, I do some pencil drawing/sketching for relaxing purposes. I think, I will upload some of my work in the near future. ðŸ˜„
